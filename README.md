# Overview

I created a flashcard app that will cycle through study sets, and allow for the ability to flilp through the cards that were provided. Additionally, many easter eggs can be found in the console (recursion, ES6 Javascript)

I wrote this application to help study terms, especially foreing languages that hold the term and a definition or other concepts like vocabulary words.
